# state-machete

Functional statecharts implementation for Clojure and ClojureScript.

Documentation is missing at the moment, but there is a very extensive test suite that can be consulted.

Implementation is based on the SCXML standard, and test suite is ported from the [SCION](https://gitlab.com/scion-scxml) project.
